# Building a Movie Recommender using the Movie Lens Dataset

**In this project, we will explore two types of recommender systems: 1) collaborative filtering, and 2) content-based filtering. We will build our own recommendation system using the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/home) dataset in Python.**

### What is MovieLens?

MovieLens is a recommender system that was developed by GroupLens, a computer science research lab at the University of Minnesota. It recommends movies to its users based on their movie ratings. It is also a dataset that is widely used in research and teaching contexts.

**This project is based on the following tutorial from Jill Cates (Data Scientist, Shopify). [tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfAe-HLysOM)**
